This is a simple program that will assist in hastily developing projects.
Making it publicly available is one way to improve the processes we will make together. The makefile is from http://electrons.psychogenic.com, and all the credit for making that part of the process easier goes to them.

This configuration assumes the following:
1. You're using the usbtinyISP programmer from adafruit.com
2. You are wired properly
3. You are utilizing the ATTiny85 microcontroller compatible footprint device

Have fun.
