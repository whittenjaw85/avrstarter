This is a simple program that will assist in hastily developing projects.
Making it publicly available is one way to improve the processes we will make together. The makefile is from http://electrons.psychogenic.com, and all the credit for making that part of the process easier goes to them.

To get the program written to your device, wire it up and type `sudo make writeflash`. All the configuration assumes a few things:
1. You're using an ATMega328PU (not just P)
2. You are using the usbtiny programmer
3. You are wired up properly.
4. You substitute or append your `/etc/avrdude.conf` file with the extra microcontroller device.

Frankly, avrdude isn't configured to utilize the ATMega328PU microcontroller, but the fuses and everything are configured the same as the ATMEGA328P, so you can copy the section and change the device name and signature to match the appropriate configuration. That's the only thing changed.
